Overview
Offensive security focuses on identifying and exploiting security weaknesses within a system to understand how attackers operate. It's an essential component of cybersecurity that helps professionals strengthen defenses by simulating real-world attacks.

Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will:

Understand what offensive security is.
Learn the basic tools and techniques used in offensive security.
Be introduced to penetration testing and ethical hacking.
Understand the importance of ethical hacking in modern cybersecurity.
1. What is Offensive Security?
Offensive security is a proactive and adversarial approach to protecting information systems. Unlike defensive security, which focuses on protecting systems from attacks, offensive security aims to find and exploit vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do.

2. Key Terminology
Ethical Hacking: The practice of legally and ethically hacking systems to identify vulnerabilities.
Penetration Testing (Pen Testing): Simulating an attack on a system to find vulnerabilities.
Red Teaming: A full-scale attack simulation that mimics real-world adversaries.
Vulnerability: A weakness in a system that could be exploited to cause harm.
Exploit: A method or tool used to take advantage of a vulnerability.

3. Types of Attacks in Offensive Security
Social Engineering: Manipulating people to give up confidential information.
Network Attacks:

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM): Intercepting communication between two parties.
Denial-of-Service (DoS): Flooding a system with traffic to make it unavailable.
Web Application Attacks:
SQL Injection: Inserting malicious SQL code into a query to manipulate databases.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others.
Malware: Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a system.
4. Phases of an Offensive Security Engagement
Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

Passive (no direct interaction) and active (direct interaction) methods of gathering information about a target.
Tools: Google Dorking, Shodan, WHOIS, and social media.
Scanning and Enumeration

Identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
Tools: Nmap (network mapping), Nessus (vulnerability scanning).
Gaining Access

Exploiting vulnerabilities to enter a system.
Tools: Metasploit Framework, Exploit-DB.
Maintaining Access

Once inside a system, an attacker tries to maintain control for future exploitation.
Techniques: Backdoors, rootkits.
Covering Tracks

Deleting or modifying logs to prevent detection.
Importance: Ethical hackers should not do this in real-world engagements. Only attackers seek to hide their presence.

5. Common Tools in Offensive Security
Kali Linux: A Linux distribution pre-loaded with a wide range of penetration testing tools.
Metasploit: A tool for developing and executing exploits against vulnerable systems.
Wireshark: A network protocol analyzer for monitoring traffic.
Burp Suite: A tool for testing web application security.
Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET): A framework designed for conducting social engineering attacks.

6. Ethical Hacking vs. Malicious Hacking
Ethical Hacking: Done with permission, following a code of conduct, and aimed at improving security.
Malicious Hacking: Done illegally with the intent to cause harm or gain unauthorized access.
Ethical hackers must always:

Obtain written consent before testing.
Avoid causing damage to systems.
Report all vulnerabilities discovered.
Help organizations improve their defenses.

7. Real-Life Application of Offensive Security
Many organizations, including large corporations, governments, and even small businesses, hire ethical hackers to test their systems. These professionals play an essential role in identifying weaknesses and helping to secure critical infrastructures.

8. Career Opportunities in Offensive Security
Penetration Tester: Conducts regular tests on networks and systems to find vulnerabilities.
Red Team Member: Engages in adversarial simulations to test a company's security.
Security Researcher: Discovers new vulnerabilities and develops patches or fixes.
Bug Bounty Hunter: Finds vulnerabilities in software and websites for monetary rewards.

9. Legal and Ethical Considerations
Legal Framework: Offensive security activities must comply with laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Code of Conduct: Ethical hackers must follow strict ethical guidelines to avoid causing harm or violating privacy.

10. Conclusion
Offensive security is a proactive and crucial part of modern cybersecurity. By learning offensive techniques, ethical hackers can help organizations identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before real attackers exploit them. Remember, offensive security is about responsibility, ethics, and helping to make the cyber world safer for everyone.

Overview
Firewalls are an essential part of any security infrastructure, acting as the first line of defense against unauthorized access. Offensive security professionals often assess firewalls to find weaknesses in network security. This lecture will explain the concept of firewalls, how they work, and how offensive security techniques target them. We'll also include a hands-on exercise to explore firewall functionality.

Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will:

Understand what firewalls are and how they work.
Learn how firewalls fit into the broader network security landscape.
Explore how offensive security experts test and bypass firewalls.
Conduct a hands-on exercise to understand firewall rules and configurations.
1. What is a Firewall?
A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on predefined security rules. Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both.

2. Types of Firewalls
Packet Filtering Firewall: Examines packets of data as they pass through, allowing or denying based on source/destination IP, port number, and protocol.
Stateful Inspection Firewall: Monitors active connections and makes decisions based on the state and context of traffic.
Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): Goes beyond stateful inspection, incorporating features like deep packet inspection, application awareness, and intrusion prevention.
Proxy Firewall: Acts as an intermediary between a user and the internet, analyzing data at the application layer.
Unified Threat Management (UTM): A solution that includes a firewall alongside other security services like antivirus, VPN, and intrusion detection.

3. How Firewalls Relate to Offensive Security
Firewalls can limit an attacker's ability to exploit vulnerabilities within a network by controlling traffic flow. However, offensive security professionals test firewall configurations to find weak points that may allow them to bypass defenses.

Penetration Testing on Firewalls: Involves identifying open ports, services, and misconfigurations that could allow unauthorized access.
Firewall Evasion Techniques: Attackers use methods like tunneling, spoofing, or fragmentation to bypass firewalls.
Reconnaissance: Attackers can use tools like Nmap to scan for open ports and services, helping identify firewall rules.

4. Firewall Rules and Configuration
Firewalls operate on a set of rules (called Access Control Lists, or ACLs) that determine whether traffic should be allowed or blocked. These rules are based on:

Source IP/Port
Destination IP/Port
Protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)
Direction (inbound or outbound traffic)

Firewall Rule Example:
Allow TCP traffic from internal network (192.168.1.0/24) to any destination on port 80 (HTTP).
Deny all other traffic to external networks.


5. Hands-On Lab: Configuring and Testing a Firewall
We will configure and test basic firewall rules using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Linux. UFW simplifies the process of managing iptables rules for beginner users.

Step 1: Install UFW
If UFW is not installed on your system, install it with the following command:

bash
sudo apt-get install ufw

Step 2: Enable the Firewall
Start UFW and set it to enable automatically at boot:

bash
sudo ufw enable

Step 3: Check Firewall Status
To verify that the firewall is active, check its status:

bash
sudo ufw status
This will show you whether the firewall is active and which rules are applied.

Step 4: Set Basic Rules
Allow SSH (port 22):

bash
sudo ufw allow ssh

Allow HTTP (port 80):
bash
sudo ufw allow http

Allow HTTPS (port 443):
bash
sudo ufw allow https
Block All Incoming Traffic (except those explicitly allowed):

bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming

Allow All Outgoing Traffic:
bash
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

Step 5: Testing the Firewall Rules
Test allowed services: Use curl or a web browser to access a website, which should work as HTTP and HTTPS traffic are allowed.
bash
curl http://example.com

Test blocked traffic: Try to access a port or service that is not allowed, e.g., port 1234, to verify that the traffic is blocked.
bash
nc -zv 192.168.1.10 1234

Step 6: Log Firewall Activity
Enable logging to see what traffic is being allowed or blocked by the firewall:

bash
sudo ufw logging on

To view the logs:

bash
tail -f /var/log/ufw.log


6. Offensive Security Techniques for Testing Firewalls
Penetration testers use specific techniques to test and bypass firewalls during an offensive security engagement. Common techniques include:

Port Scanning: Tools like Nmap are used to detect open ports and services behind a firewall.

bash
nmap -Pn -p 1-65535 <target IP>
This scans all 65,535 ports on the target to see which ones are open.

Banner Grabbing: Attackers attempt to gather information about services running on open ports by "grabbing" the banner (response header) from the service.

bash
nc <target IP> <open port>


Firewall Evasion Techniques:

Fragmentation: Attackers send fragmented packets to bypass stateful inspection firewalls that may not properly reassemble them.
Tunneling: Encapsulating traffic within protocols allowed by the firewall, such as tunneling malicious traffic over HTTP or HTTPS.
Spoofing IP Addresses: Attackers may spoof their IP address to bypass simple packet-filtering firewalls that rely solely on source IP.


7. Hands-On Lab: Firewall Penetration Testing
In this exercise, we will use Nmap to perform a basic penetration test on a target protected by a firewall.

Step 1: Port Scanning
Run the following Nmap command to scan all ports on a target:

bash
nmap -Pn -p- <target IP>

Step 2: Service Detection
Use Nmap's service detection feature to identify the services running behind the firewall:

bash
nmap -sV <target IP>
Step 3: Firewall Evasion (Optional)
Attempt to bypass the firewall using a fragmented packet scan:

bash
nmap -f <target IP>

Step 4: Analyze the Results
Review the scan results to identify open ports and services that may be vulnerable. Discuss how these results could help an attacker find entry points.

8. Conclusion
Firewalls are a critical component of network security, acting as the first line of defense against unauthorized access. In offensive security, understanding and testing firewall rules and configurations is crucial for identifying weaknesses in an organization's defenses. Through the hands-on lab, we've learned how to configure a firewall using UFW, test firewall rules, and simulate penetration testing techniques to assess firewalls.`

Overview
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security solution that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. In offensive security, understanding how an IDS operates allows attackers to either evade detection or generate alerts to test defenses. This lecture will introduce the concepts behind IDS, how they work, and how offensive security techniques interact with them, followed by a step-by-step hands-on exercise.

Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will:

Understand what an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is.
Learn the difference between IDS types and detection techniques.
Explore how offensive security professionals attempt to evade IDS.
Conduct a hands-on exercise using a popular IDS tool, Snort.
1. What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?
An IDS is a tool that detects malicious activity or violations of security policies within a network or system by analyzing traffic or log data. It does not prevent attacks, but it alerts administrators when suspicious activity is detected.

2. Types of IDS
Network-based IDS (NIDS):

Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities.
Typically deployed at strategic points within the network (e.g., near firewalls or routers).
Example: Snort.
Host-based IDS (HIDS):

Monitors activities on individual hosts, such as system files, applications, and log files.
Example: OSSEC.

3. IDS Detection Techniques
Signature-based Detection:

Relies on predefined patterns (signatures) of known threats to detect attacks.
Weakness: Cannot detect zero-day attacks (new threats).
Anomaly-based Detection:

Compares current activity with a baseline of normal behavior. Deviations from this baseline trigger alerts.
Strength: Can detect new or unknown threats.
Hybrid Detection:

Combines both signature-based and anomaly-based approaches for more comprehensive detection.

4. How IDS Relates to Offensive Security
Evasion Techniques: Attackers may use methods to avoid detection by IDS, such as:

Fragmenting packets to confuse the IDS.
Using encrypted channels to hide payloads.
Polymorphic attacks that change their structure to evade signature-based detection.
Penetration Testing of IDS: Penetration testers simulate attacks to see how well the IDS responds, analyzing whether it detects malicious activity and how accurately it raises alerts.

5. IDS Deployment Strategies
Inline IDS: Positioned in the direct path of network traffic. Traffic is analyzed in real-time.
Passive IDS: Monitors network traffic by tapping into the network through a mirror port. Traffic isn’t interrupted but analyzed in real-time.


6. Hands-On Lab: Using Snort as an IDS
For this exercise, we'll use Snort, one of the most popular open-source Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS).

Step 1: Install Snort
Update your system:

bash
sudo apt-get update
Install Snort:

bash
sudo apt-get install snort
During the installation process, you'll be asked to define the network range you want to protect (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24). Provide the relevant network range.

Step 2: Configure Snort
Open Snort’s configuration file in a text editor:

bash
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
Define the network variable: Locate the line ipvar HOME_NET and set it to your network’s range:

bash
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
Choose appropriate rule sets: Snort uses rules to detect intrusions. By default, Snort comes with some basic rules. You can download additional rules from the Snort website or use community-contributed rules.

Step 3: Test Snort in IDS Mode
Run Snort in IDS mode to start monitoring traffic:

bash
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
-A console: Tells Snort to print alerts to the console.
-c /etc/snort/snort.conf: Specifies the configuration file to use.
-i eth0: Specifies the network interface to monitor.
This command starts Snort in intrusion detection mode, monitoring traffic on your network.

Step 4: Simulate an Attack
We will simulate some traffic that may trigger Snort's alert mechanisms:

Ping Sweep: A basic reconnaissance technique attackers use to discover live hosts on a network. Run this from a different machine or virtual machine on the same network:

bash
ping -c 5 192.168.1.1
Port Scan: Use Nmap to scan for open ports on a target machine:

bash
nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
This should trigger alerts in Snort, as port scans are common indicators of potential attacks.

Step 5: Analyze Alerts
Snort will print out alerts in real-time on the console. Look for alerts that match the traffic you simulated, like "ICMP Echo Request" for the ping sweep or "SYN Scan" for the port scan.

Example output:

bash
[**] [1:1000001:0] ICMP Echo Request [**]
[Classification: Attempted Information Leak] [Priority: 2]
08/10-10:45:23.123456 192.168.1.100 -> 192.168.1.1
ICMP TTL:64 TOS:0x0 ID:54321 IpLen:20 DgmLen:84
Type:8  Code:0  ID:12345   Seq:1  ECHO


7. Offensive Security Techniques for Evading IDS
In offensive security, penetration testers simulate attacks to test whether an IDS can detect them, but they also test methods for evading detection. Some common IDS evasion techniques include:

Packet Fragmentation: Attackers split their payload into smaller packets to evade detection:

bash
nmap -f <target IP>
Polymorphic Shellcode: Attackers use self-modifying code to avoid detection by signature-based IDS. This requires advanced coding techniques and is typically used in payloads sent through vulnerable systems.

Using Encrypted Channels: Attackers may use SSL or SSH tunnels to encrypt communication, making it harder for the IDS to analyze the payloads.

Slow Scan: By slowing down the pace of a port scan, an attacker might avoid detection, as the IDS may not register the scan as an attack due to long time intervals:

bash
nmap -T2 <target IP>


8. Hands-On Lab: Evading IDS
In this exercise, we will simulate an evasion technique using Nmap to perform a fragmented packet scan.

Step 1: Perform a Fragmented Scan
Run an Nmap scan that sends fragmented packets:

bash
nmap -f <target IP>
The fragmented packets are harder for the IDS to reassemble, and some IDS configurations may fail to detect the scan properly.

Step 2: Review IDS Response
Check Snort’s console or log files to see if the fragmented scan was detected. If the IDS rules aren’t tuned to detect fragmented packets, this evasion attempt might go unnoticed.

9. Conclusion
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a critical role in monitoring and detecting suspicious activities in a network. Offensive security professionals test these systems to ensure they can detect malicious behavior while also experimenting with evasion techniques to simulate real-world attack scenarios. By understanding how IDS works and how to test its defenses, penetration testers can help improve an organization’s security posture.`

Overview
Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous threats in web security, where attackers trick users into providing sensitive information by impersonating legitimate entities. This lecture will cover how to identify phishing attacks, common techniques used by attackers, and strategies for mitigating phishing threats, followed by hands-on exercises to enhance your understanding.

Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will:

Understand what phishing is and its various forms.
Identify the different techniques used in phishing attacks.
Learn how to mitigate phishing threats through security awareness and technical measures.
Conduct hands-on exercises to recognize phishing attempts and configure phishing prevention tools.

1. What is Phishing?
Phishing is a form of cyberattack where attackers masquerade as trusted entities to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. It typically occurs via email, social media, or malicious websites.

Common Phishing Techniques:
Email Phishing: Attackers send fraudulent emails posing as legitimate organizations to trick users into revealing sensitive data or downloading malicious software.
Spear Phishing: A more targeted form of phishing, where attackers personalize emails to specific individuals or organizations.
Clone Phishing: Attackers replicate legitimate emails but modify the links or attachments to redirect victims to malicious websites.
Smishing and Vishing: Phishing through SMS (smishing) or phone calls (vishing) to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information.

2. How Phishing Works
Phishing attacks typically follow these steps:

Baiting: The attacker sends a message that looks like it's from a legitimate source, often containing urgent or alarming messages to prompt action.
Luring: The victim clicks on a link or downloads an attachment, unknowingly initiating the attack.
Harvesting: The victim is redirected to a fake website or malware is installed, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data.
Exploitation: The attacker uses the stolen information for identity theft, financial fraud, or further attacks.

3. How to Identify Phishing Threats
Phishing attacks can be subtle but often share common signs. Key indicators of phishing emails or websites include:

Suspicious URLs: Look for subtle changes in domain names (e.g., "amazon-security-check.com" instead of "amazon.com").
Unusual Senders: Emails from unexpected sources or generic email addresses (e.g., support@service-help.com instead of official company domains).
Grammar and Spelling Mistakes: Legitimate organizations usually send well-written messages, while phishing emails often contain errors.
Urgent or Threatening Language: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency (e.g., "Your account will be suspended if you don't take action immediately").
Unsolicited Attachments or Links: Be wary of unsolicited attachments or links asking for personal information.

4. Real-World Examples of Phishing
PayPal Phishing: Attackers send emails claiming there's an issue with a PayPal account, asking users to click a link and re-enter their credentials on a fake PayPal website.

COVID-19 Phishing: During the pandemic, phishing campaigns pretended to be official health organizations providing updates or relief but redirected victims to malicious websites.

5. How to Mitigate Phishing Threats
There are two primary methods for mitigating phishing threats: Security Awareness and Technical Solutions.

A. Security Awareness
Employee Training: Regular training sessions to educate employees about phishing risks, recognizing phishing emails, and safe online behavior.
Phishing Simulations: Conduct simulated phishing campaigns to test the awareness and readiness of employees to recognize phishing attempts.
Verify Requests for Sensitive Information: Train users to verify requests for sensitive information through official channels, avoiding interaction with unsolicited emails.
B. Technical Solutions
Email Filtering: Use spam filters and anti-phishing email solutions to block malicious emails.
Example: Microsoft 365 Advanced Threat Protection or Google Workspace Email Security.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA for all user accounts. Even if phishing is successful, attackers will still require a second authentication factor.
SSL/TLS Certificates: Ensure all websites use HTTPS, as users can verify whether they are interacting with a legitimate site.
URL Filtering: Block access to known malicious websites and phishing domains.
Browser Security Features: Enable browser-based security measures, such as anti-phishing tools and safe browsing features (e.g., Google's Safe Browsing).

6. Hands-On Lab: Recognizing and Blocking Phishing Emails
In this exercise, we’ll simulate a phishing scenario and then implement protections using both awareness and technical controls.

Step 1: Simulate a Phishing Attack
Receive a Phishing Email:

Use a phishing email template (or create one) that appears to come from a legitimate source (e.g., bank, online store).
The email should contain a link to a fake login page.
Review the Email for Phishing Signs:

Analyze the sender address (check if it’s a legitimate domain).
Hover over the links in the email and inspect the URL for suspicious patterns.
Look for grammar and spelling errors or unusual attachments.

Step 2: Enable Phishing Protection in Gmail
Open Gmail settings:

Go to the settings gear icon in Gmail, and select "See all settings".
Enable Phishing and Spam Detection:

Under the Filters and Blocked Addresses tab, you can configure Gmail to block suspicious senders.
Use the Phishing Protection option under the General tab to enhance your email filtering.
Enable Safe Browsing in Google Chrome:

Open Settings > Privacy and Security > Security > Enable Enhanced protection to block known phishing sites.

Step 3: Phishing Awareness Test
Set Up a Phishing Simulation:

Use tools like Gophish or KnowBe4 to send simulated phishing emails to yourself or other test accounts.
See if the email gets flagged by your email filtering tools, or if users can detect the phishing attempt.
Review Results:

Did the phishing email get through the email filters?
Were users able to identify the phishing attempt?
Step 4: Report a Phishing Attempt
In Gmail: Open the phishing email and click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner, then select "Report Phishing".
In Microsoft Outlook: Right-click on the phishing email and choose "Mark as Phishing".

7. Offensive Security Techniques for Phishing Simulations
Phishing simulations are used in offensive security to assess how vulnerable an organization is to phishing attacks. Penetration testers create controlled phishing campaigns to test awareness and response. Techniques include:

Social Engineering: Pen testers craft emails that mimic real-world phishing attacks using techniques such as:

Impersonating executives (CEO Fraud).
Offering fake incentives (e.g., gift cards).
Using compromised or spoofed domains.
Spear Phishing: Testers target specific individuals, tailoring emails to their role within an organization for a higher success rate.

Malicious Links: Test whether employees click on URLs leading to credential harvesting websites or download harmful attachments.

8. Hands-On Lab: Using Gophish for Phishing Simulations
In this exercise, we will set up a phishing simulation using Gophish, a popular open-source phishing simulation tool.

Step 1: Install Gophish
Download Gophish from the official GitHub repository:

bash
wget https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/download/v0.11.0/gophish-v0.11-linux-64bit.zip
Extract the zip file:

bash
unzip gophish-v0.11-linux-64bit.zip
cd gophish

Start the Gophish server:

bash
./gophish

Step 2: Set Up a Phishing Campaign
Log in to Gophish’s web interface at https://localhost:3333 (default credentials: admin/gophish).
Create Email Templates: Design a phishing email that looks legitimate but contains links to a phishing landing page.
Set Up a Landing Page: Create a fake login page to simulate credential harvesting.
Launch the Campaign: Send the phishing email to test users and monitor who clicks the link or enters credentials.

Step 3: Analyze Results
Check Gophish’s dashboard to see how many users opened the email, clicked the link, or entered credentials.
Review how effective your email filtering tools were in blocking or detecting the phishing email.

9. Conclusion
Phishing is a significant threat to web security, but with the right awareness training and technical controls, it can be effectively mitigated. Identifying phishing signs, implementing multi-factor authentication, and conducting phishing simulations are essential steps in defending against these attacks. Through this hands-on lab, we learned how to recognize phishing emails, implement protective measures, and simulate phishing attacks to test security awareness.`
